To install the Mailchimp app you must first get an API key. To do this, login to your 
[Mailchimp account](https://mailchimp.com) and head over to the "Account & Billing" page.

Copy the API key for a later step. It's **important that you keep your secret API token safe**.

Your API key will look something like this:

`7c8a402742aa45ddbec16aaa029a79c1-us20`

Enter the API key as follows:

* **Domain** - Enter the last portion of the API key, in this case it will be `us20`
* **API Key** - Enter the entire API key here, `7c8a402742aa45ddbec16aaa029a79c1-us20`

To configure who can see and use the Mailchimp app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups
you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
