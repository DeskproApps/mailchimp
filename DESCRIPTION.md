# Mailchimp
Build campaign lists, track engagement, and manage your users' Mailchimp mailing preferences from within Deskpro.

## Description
***Manage audiences user is in:*** Choose to subscribe or unsubscribe users from any of the audiences set up on your Mailchimp account.

***Manage methods of communication:*** Change user preferences for how they would like to be contacted for each audience they are in.

***View campaign emails:*** View emails sent to the user as well as their state to see any interactions the user has had with the campaign emails they have been sent.

## Configuration
Set up requires the generation of an API key to authenticate the app. To generate an API key, go to "account settings" in Mailchimp - the domain is the last digits after the hyphen beginning with "us" (e.g. "us19").
